abstract: 'Multimodal image-text memes are widely used on social networks and present
  significant challenges for high-precision sentiment analysis, social network analysis,
  and understanding diverse user communities, especially due to their deep cultural
  and regional influences. However, most existing studies on multimodal memes focus
  primarily on Englishspeaking communities and on preliminary tasks, such as harmful
  meme detection. In this paper, we focus on a more specific challenge: high-precision
  sarcasm classification in various contexts. We introduce a novel dataset for classifying
  sarcasm in multimodal memes, covering both Chinese and English languages. This dataset
  serves as a critical resource for developing and evaluating models that detect sarcasm
  across different cultural contexts. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Mmeets,
  which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and abductive reasoning to interpret
  the relationships between images and text, enhancing text understanding. Mmeets
  employs a pre-trained AltCLIP vision-language model alongside a cross-attention
  mechanism to effectively fuse image and text data, capturing subtle semantic connections.
  Our experimental results show that the Mmeets method outperforms state-of-the-art
  techniques in sarcasm classification tasks.'
