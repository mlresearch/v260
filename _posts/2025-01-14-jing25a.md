abstract: Fraud detection has emerged as a pivotal process in different fields (e.g.,
  e-commerce, social networks). Since interactions among entities provide valuable
  insights into fraudulent activities, such behaviors can be naturally represented
  as graphs, where graph neural networks (GNNs) have been developed as prominent models
  to boost the efficacy of fraud detection. However, the application of GNNs in this
  domain encounters significant challenges, primarily due to class imbalance and a
  mixture of homophily and heterophily of fraud graphs. To address these challenges,
  in this paper, we propose LACA, which implements fraud detection on graphs using
  Label-Aware feature aggregation to advance GNN training, which is regularized by
  Clustering Augmented optimization. Specifically, label-aware feature aggregation
  simplifies adaptive aggregation in homophily-heterophily mixed neighborhoods, preventing
  gradient domination by legitimate nodes and mitigating class imbalance in message
  passing. Clustering-augmented optimization provides fine-grained subclass semantics
  to improve detection performance, and yields additional benefit in addressing class
  imbalance. Extensive experiments on four fraud datasets demonstrate that LACA can
  significantly improve fraud detection performance on graphs with different imbalance
  ratios and homophily ratios, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN models.
