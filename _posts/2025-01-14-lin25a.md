abstract: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) aims to retrieve a set
  of person images captured from both visible and infrared camera views. Addressing
  the challenge of modal differences between visible and infrared images, we propose
  a VI-ReID network based on Feature Fusion and Deep Mutual Learning (DML). To enhance
  the model’s robustness to color, we introduce a novel data augmentation method called
  Random Combination of Channels (RCC), which generates new images by randomly combining
  R, G, and B channels of visible images. Furthermore, to capture more informative
  features of individuals, we fuse the features from the middle layer of the network.
  To reduce the model’s dependence on global features, we employ a fusion branch as
  an auxiliary branch, facilitating synchronous learning of global and fusion branches
  through Deep Mutual Learning . Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01 and RegDB
  datasets validate the superiority of our method, showcasing its excellent performance
  when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.
