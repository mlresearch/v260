abstract: "The interpretability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has emerged as a crucial
  area of research, particularly in image classification tasks where decisions often
  lack transparency. Saliency maps have been widely used as a tool to decode the inner
  workings of these networks by highlighting regions of input images deemed most influential
  in the classification process. However, recent studies have revealed significant
  limitations and inconsistencies in the utility of saliency maps as explanations.
  \r This paper aims to systematically assess the shortcomings of saliency maps and
  explore alternative approaches to achieve more reliable and interpretable explanations
  for image classification models.\r We carry out a series of experiments to show
  that 1) the existing evaluation does not provide a fair nor meaningful comparison
  to the existing saliency maps; these evaluations have their implicit assumption
  and are not differentiable; 2) the saliency maps do not provide enough information
  on explaining the accuracy of network, the relationship between classes and the
  modification of the images."
