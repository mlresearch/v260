abstract: Transcriptional regulation through cis-regulatory elements (CREs) is crucial
  for numerous biological functions, with its disruption potentially leading to various
  diseases. These CREs often exhibit redundancy, allowing them to compensate for each
  other in response to external disturbances, highlighting the need for methods to
  identify CRE sets that collaboratively regulate gene expression effectively. To
  address this, we introduce GRIDS, an in silico computational method that approaches
  the task as a global feature explanation challenge to dissect combinatorial CRE
  effects in two phases. First, GRIDS constructs a differentiable surrogate function
  to mirror the complex gene regulatory process, facilitating cross-translations in
  single-cell modalities. It then employs learnable perturbations within a state transition
  framework to offer global explanations, efficiently navigating the combinatorial
  feature landscape. Through comprehensive benchmarks, GRIDS demonstrates superior
  explanatory capabilities compared to other leading methods. Moreover, GRIDSâ€™s global
  explanations reveal intricate regulatory redundancy across cell types and states,
  underscoring its potential to advance our understanding of cellular regulation in
  biological research.
