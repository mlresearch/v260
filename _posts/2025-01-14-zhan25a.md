abstract: 'The presence of noisy labels has always been a primary factor affecting
  the effectiveness of federated learning (FL). Conventional FL approaches relying
  on Supervised Learning (SL) tend to overfit the noise labels, resulting in suboptimal
  Feature Extractor (FE). In this paper, we exploit models obtained in Self-Supervised
  Learning (SSL) to mitigate the impact of noisy labels in FL. In addition, we explore
  two popular methods to transfer to downstream tasks: linear probing, which updates
  only the last classification layers, and fine-tuning, which updates all model parameters.
  We empirically observe that, although fine-tuning typically yields higher accuracy
  than linear probing, in the presence of noise, it is very sensitive to noisy labels
  and will cause performance degradation. To achieve the best of both worlds (i.e.,
  high accuracy and robustness against noisy labels), we “teach” fine-tuning to control
  overfitting. In particular, we leverage SSL to obtain a robust FE that is unaffected
  by noisy labels, and employ linear probing to train the classifiers. The FE and
  classifiers are integrated to construct a teacher model, which undergoes knowledge
  distillation to instruct the fine-tuning process of the student model. Extensive
  experimental evaluations conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
  and robustness of our proposed framework against noisy labels in FL, outperforming
  state-of-the-art methods.'
