abstract: The goal of Synthetic Speech Detection (SSD) is to detect spoofing speech
  synthesized by text-to-speech and voice conversion. Most existing SSD methods focus
  only on mining frequency-wise dependency by customizing frequency-aggregation modules
  in SSD models. However, the instance-wise dependency is usually under-explored,
  which is critical for identifying the synthetic speech in a global view. In this
  paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic training strategy for SSD that exploits
  both local (frequency-wise) and global (instance-wise) contexts, which do not rely
  on a customized architecture and can be flexibly integrated into previous SSD models.
  Specifically, we propose an inter-frequency correlation module to capture the local
  context by reconstructing the masked frequency information from the unmasked frequency
  context. Meanwhile, an inter-instance correlation module is performed to explore
  the global context among different instances by promoting intra-class compactness
  and inter-class dispersion in the latent space. These two complementary modules
  operate from distinct contextual perspectives, leading to improvements in SSD performance.
  Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the performance
  of two state-of-the-art models on the 2019 dataset and 2021 dataset of ASVspoof.
