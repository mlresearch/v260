abstract: In an era overwhelmed by a deluge of global information, it is often challenging
  for people to grasp the relationships that an event develops over time. The background
  summarization (BS) task facilitates a profound understanding of the relationships
  between the current background of an event at any given time and its historical
  backgrounds. To enhance comprehension and help news readers and professionals to
  quickly understand the evolution of events, we introduce a Historical information-driven
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (HiRAG). This framework is designed to
  extract the most relevant information from historical backgrounds and supplement
  it to generate precise background summarization. HiRAG employs state-of-the-art
  retrieval-augmented generation technologies to produce relevant background summarization.
  We implement a multi-strategy similarity calculation and introduce a sliding window
  mechanism to optimize retrieval construction. Our framework has been rigorously
  tested through a series of experiments and extensive analyses of the latest datasets.
  The promising results affirm the effectiveness of our proposed HiRAG framework and
  its retrieval capabilities.
