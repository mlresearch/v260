abstract: 'Few-shot Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to identify named entities
  using very little annotated data. Recently, prompt-based few-shot NER methods have
  demonstrated significant effectiveness. However, most existing methods employ multi-round
  prompts, which significantly increase time and computational costs. Furthermore,
  current single-round prompt methods are mainly designed for flat NER tasks and are
  not effective in handling nested NER tasks. Additionally, these methods do not to
  fully utilize the semantic information of entity labels through prompts. To address
  these challenges, we propose a novel Label-Prompt-based few-shot nested NER method
  named LPNER, which not only handles nested NER tasks but also efficiently extracts
  semantic information of entities through label prompts, thereby achieving more efficient
  and accurate NER. LPNER first designs a specialized prompt based on a span strategy
  to enhance label semantics and effectively combines multiple span representations
  using special mark to obtain enhanced span representations integrated with label
  semantics. Then, entity prototypes are constructed through prototype network for
  classifying candidate entity spans. We conducted extensive experiments on five nested
  datasets: ACE04, ACE05, GENIA, GermEval, and NEREL. In 1-shot and 5-shot tasks,
  LPNERâ€™s $F_1$ scores mostly outperform baseline models.'
