abstract: The composed image retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target image given the
  combination of an image and a textual description as a query. Recently, benefiting
  from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models and large language models (LLM), the
  use of textual inversion or generating large-scale datasets has become a novel approach
  for zero-shot CIR task (ZS-CIR). However, the existing ZS-CIR models overlook one
  case where the textual description is often too brief or inherently inaccurate,
  making it challenging to effectively integrate the reference image into the query
  for retrieving the target image. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet
  effective methodâ€”prompting vision-language fusion (PVLF), which adapts representations
  in VLP models to dynamically fuse the vision and language (V&L) representation spaces.
  In addition, by injecting the context learnable prompt tokens in Transformer fusion
  encoder, the PVLF promotes the comprehensive coupling between V&L modalities, enriching
  the semantic representation of the query. We evaluate the effectiveness and robustness
  of our method on various VLP backbones, and the experimental results show that the
  proposed PVLF outperforms previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art on
  two public ZS-CIR benchmarks (CIRR and FashionIQ).
