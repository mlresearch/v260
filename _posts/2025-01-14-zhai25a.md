abstract: Translating NIR to the visible spectrum is challenging due to cross-domain
  complexities. Current models struggle to balance a broad receptive field with computational
  efficiency, limiting practical use. Although the Selective Structured State Space
  Model, especially the improved version, Mamba, excels in generative tasks by capturing
  long-range dependencies with linear complexity, its default approach of converting
  2D images into 1D sequences neglects local context. In this work, we propose a simple
  but effective backbone, dubbed ColorMamba, which first introduces Mamba into spectral
  translation tasks. To explore global long-range dependencies and local context for
  efficient spectral translation, we introduce learnable padding tokens to enhance
  the distinction of image boundaries and prevent potential confusion within the sequence
  model. Furthermore, local convolutional enhancement and agent attention are designed
  to improve the vanilla Mamba. Moreover, we exploit the HSV color to provide multi-scale
  guidance in the reconstruction process for more accurate spectral translation. Extensive
  experiments show that our ColorMamba achieves a 1.02 improvement in terms of PSNR
  compared with the state-of-the-art method. Our code is available at https://github.com/AlexYangxx/ColorMamba/.
