abstract: 'Federated learning offers a solution paradigm to the challenge of preserving
  privacy in distributed machine learning. However, datasets distributed across each
  client in the real world are inevitably heterogeneous, and if the datasets can be
  globally aggregated, they collectively exhibit long-tailed distribution, which greatly
  affects the performance of the model. The traditional approach to federated learning
  primarily addresses the heterogeneity of data among clients, yet it fails to address
  the phenomenon of class bias in global long-tailed data. This results in the trained
  model focusing on the head classes while neglecting the equally important tail classes.
  Consequently, it is essential to develop a methodology that can consider classes
  holistically. To address the above problems, we propose a new method called FedLF,
  which introduces three modifications in the local training phase: adaptive logit
  adjustment, continuous class centred optimization, and feature decorrelation. We
  compare seven different methods with varying degrees of data heterogeneity and long-tailed
  distribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets CIFAR-10-LT and CIFAR-100-LT
  demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the problem of model performance
  degradation due to data heterogeneity and long-tailed distribution. our code is
  available at https://github.com/18sym/FedLF.'
