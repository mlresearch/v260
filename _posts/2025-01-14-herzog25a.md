abstract: Self-supervised pre-training has achieved remarkable success in NLP and
  2D vision. However, these advances have yet to translate to 3D data. Techniques
  like masked reconstruction face inherent challenges on unstructured point clouds,
  while many contrastive learning tasks lack in complexity and informative value.
  In this paper, we present Pic@Point, an effective contrastive learning method based
  on structural 2D-3D correspondences. We leverage image cues rich in semantic and
  contextual knowledge to provide a guiding signal for point cloud representations
  at various abstraction levels. Our lightweight approach outperforms state-of-the-art
  pre-training methods on several 3D benchmarks.
