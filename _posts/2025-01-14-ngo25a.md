abstract: The objective of active level set estimation for a black-box function is
  to precisely identify regions where the function values exceed or fall below a specified
  threshold by iteratively performing function evaluations to gather more information
  about the function. This becomes particularly important when function evaluations
  are costly, drastically limiting our ability to acquire large datasets. A promising
  way to sample-efficiently model the black-box function is by incorporating prior
  knowledge from a related function. However, this approach risks slowing down the
  estimation task if the prior knowledge is irrelevant or misleading. In this paper,
  we present a novel transfer learning method for active level set estimation that
  safely integrates a given prior knowledge while constantly adjusting it to guarantee
  a robust performance of a level set estimation algorithm even when the prior knowledge
  is irrelevant. We theoretically analyze this algorithm to show that it has a better
  level set convergence compared to standard transfer learning approaches that do
  not make any adjustment to the prior. Additionally, extensive experiments across
  multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method when applied to various
  different level set estimation algorithms as well as different transfer learning
  scenarios.
