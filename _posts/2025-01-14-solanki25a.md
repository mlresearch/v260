abstract: This paper considers the contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem with
  fairness and privacy guarantees in a federated environment. We consider merit-based
  exposure as the desired \emph{fair} outcome, which provides exposure to each action
  in proportion to the reward associated. We model the algorithm’s effectiveness using
  fairness regret, which captures the difference between fair optimal policy and the
  policy output by the algorithm. Applying a fair CMAB algorithm to each agent individually
  leads to fairness regret linear in the number of agents. We propose that collaborative
  – federated learning can be more effective and provide the algorithm Fed-FairX-LinUCB
  that also ensures differential privacy. The primary challenge in extending the existing
  privacy framework is designing the communication protocol for communicating required
  information across agents. A naive protocol can either lead to weaker privacy guarantees
  or higher regret. We design a novel communication protocol that allows for (i) Sub-linear
  theoretical bounds on fairness regret for Fed-FairX-LinUCB and comparable bounds
  for the private counterpart, Priv-FairX-LinUCB (relative to single-agent learning),
  (ii) Effective use of privacy budget in Priv-FairX-LinUCB. We demonstrate the efficacy
  of our proposed algorithm with extensive simulations-based experiments. We show
  that both Fed-FairX-LinUCB and Priv-FairX-LinUCB achieve near-optimal fairness regret.
