abstract: Humans employ words to convey abstract concepts. The evolution of lexical
  semantics holds significance not only in Natural Language Processing applications
  but also in the realm of social computing research. However, the scarcity of diachronic
  word representations persists due to the substantial computational demands, particularly
  evident in the absence of large-scale and enduring diachronic word embeddings for
  social network texts. Herein, we introduce RedditEM, a comprehensive collection
  of diachronic word representations derived from Reddit English comment texts, featuring
  one word embedding per month spanning from January 2010 to December 2021. To assess
  the diachronic semantic shifts of words, we employ cosine distance metrics and juxtapose
  the embeddingsâ€™ neighborhoods. Our experimental findings underscore the utility
  of RedditEM in detecting alterations in word meanings within social networks and
  advancing social computing endeavors. Researchers interested in accessing this resource
  are cordially invited to contact us without hesitation.
