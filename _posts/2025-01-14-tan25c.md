abstract: The swift advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has outstripped
  the development of corresponding laws and regulations, highlighting books’ copyright
  infringement as a significant public concern and sparking numerous legal disputes.
  Although fair use doctrine exemption for using copyrighted materials in training
  datasets without the copyright holder’s permission, content generated by such AI
  systems may still violate copyright laws. Previous research on copyright infringement
  has primarily focused on character-level analysis, which is narrower in scope compared
  to the comprehensive requirements of copyright law. To address this challenge, we
  developed a LLM-based similarity measurement mechanism. We guided the generative
  AI to produce relevant book content by employing carefully crafted prompts. Subsequently,
  we created datasets by comparing this generated content with the original texts
  from famous books. We conducted various experiments, including various similarity
  detection techniques and plot plagiarism detection. The experimental results show
  that the AI-generated content (AIGC) is 78.72% similar to the original text, confirming
  that generative AI has the potential to infringe upon copyrights. Moreover, our
  study examines copyright infringement issues related to the content generated by
  generative AI and other domains such as code, images, and licensing. Our research
  will provide valuable insights for refining laws and regulations about generative
  AI.
