abstract: "Re-ranking is the last part of a multi-stage recommendation system, involving
  the reordering of lists based on historical user behavior to better align with user
  preferences. Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been employed in both the prediction
  and ranking phases of recommendation systems to align with long-term objectives,
  surpassing the efficacy of supervised learning.  However, extrapolation error is
  a common problem in offline RL, due to the biased distribution of features, which
  can lead to the reduction of recommendation accuracy.\r Consider that as users browse
  an e-commerce app, their preferences are influenced by previously recommended items
  or pages, therefore the history can be used to correct the bias of offline RL. This
  paper uses offline RL to model re-ranking and presents a re-ranking algorithm named
  Page and Item Sequential Decision for Re-ranking (PISDR) to improve accuracy by
  correcting bias at two levels (pages and items). PISDR employs sequential RL, leveraging
  a session-level data structure that encapsulates global information at the page
  level and item-level interrelationships. Additionally, PISDR utilizes a multi-tower
  critic network to assess various feedback metrics, including click-through rate,
  conversion rate, etc. which can raise actor network from the long-term reward. Experimental
  results validate the effectiveness of PISDR in significantly enhancing of Area Under
  Curve (AUC), Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
  (NDCG) about 1.4% in generated re-ranking sequences when compared to current state-of-the-art
  re-ranking algorithms. Finally, as a consequence, our method achieves a significant
  improvement (2.59%) in terms of Click-Through Rate (CTR) over the industrial-level
  ranking model in online A/B tests."
