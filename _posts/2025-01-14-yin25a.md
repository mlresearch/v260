abstract: 'In crowd counting, significant challenges persist due to scale variation,
  occlusion, and complex scene interference. Merging feature maps from different levels
  of the backbone network is an intuitive and efficient approach to addressing these
  issues. However, existing multi-scale merging algorithms often overlook a critical
  aspect: feature maps at different levels typically have varying resolutions, and
  traditional interpolation-based methods for feature fusion result in significant
  information loss, limiting the algorithmâ€™s multi-scale perception capability. To
  address this issue, we propose the Cross-Level Feature Relocation Module (CFRM),
  which regresses features across different levels into a unified representation space
  and utilizes a cross-level attention mechanism to transfer complementary information
  from low-resolution to high-resolution feature maps, significantly enhancing effective
  information utilization. Based on CFRM, we introduce the Cross-Level Feature Relocation
  Network (CFRNet), which exhibits strong multi-scale perception capabilities. Extensive
  experiments on five datasets and comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the
  effectiveness of CFRM.'
