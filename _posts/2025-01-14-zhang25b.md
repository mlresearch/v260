abstract: Effectively capturing the spatiotemporal dependencies between joints is
  crucial for skeleton-based action recognition. However, existing methods do not
  consider the sparsity of skeleton data, which hinders the accurate capture of complex
  posture information and subtle action variations. Moreover, the locality of temporal
  features requires the model to focus on certain key features. Yet, most methods
  overlook the impact of temporal redundancy on feature focus, resulting in ineffective
  capture of significant temporal features. To address the issue of skeleton sparsity,
  we propose a Multilevel Position-aware Attention module (MPA) that explicitly leverages
  the relative positional information of the input data to enrich spatial information.
  To achieve a more effective focus on local temporal features, we develop a Multi-scale
  Temporal Excitation module (MTE). By scaling temporal features, the MTE module elevates
  the prominence of salient features and facilitates the capture of multi-scale features.
  Furthermore, we propose a Part Partition Encoding module (PPE) to aggregate joint
  data into part data, thereby providing the model with high-level information carried
  by the interactions between body parts. The MPA, MTE, and PPE are integrated into
  a unified framework called MPAE-Net. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
  that the MPAE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on two large-scale datasets,
  NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120.
