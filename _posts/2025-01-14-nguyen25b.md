abstract: In biology, the construction of a gene co-expression network is a difficult
  research problem, due to the high dimensionality of the data and the heterogeneity
  of the samples. Furthermore, observations from two or more groups sharing the same
  biological variables require the comparison of gene co-expression patterns with
  some commonalities between the groups. In this context, we propose a mixture of
  Gaussian graphical models for paired data to estimate heterogeneous dependencies
  and recover sub-population networks from these complicated biological data with
  certain sparsity and symmetry constraints of two groups of dependent variables.
  We develop an efficient generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for
  penalized maximum likelihood estimation with the fusion of a graphical lasso penalty.
  As a result, we demonstrate the numerical performance of our method in simulation
  studies, with the new method outperforming the classical graphical lasso approach
  in terms of model fitting. A real-world application for estimating gene networks
  on a high dimensional ecological transcriptomics data set of nine-spined stickleback
  has also been provided. Our new approach identified similarities and differences
  between groups of genes from the brain and liver tissues of samples collected from
  two habitats. These results show the efficiency of our approach to the identification
  of complicated interactions from high-dimensional and heterogeneous gene expression
  data.
