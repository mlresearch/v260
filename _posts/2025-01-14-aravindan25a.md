abstract: Posterior Sampling for Reinforcement Learning (PSRL) is a well-known algorithm
  that augments model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms with Thompson
  sampling. PSRL maintains posterior distributions of the environment transition dynamics
  and the reward function, which are intractable for tasks with high-dimensional state
  and action spaces. Recent works show that dropout, used in conjunction with neural
  networks, induces variational distributions that can approximate these posteriors.
  In this paper, we propose Event-based Variational Distributions for Exploration
  (EVaDE), which are variational distributions that are useful for MBRL, especially
  when the underlying domain is object-based. We leverage the general domain knowledge
  of object-based domains to design three types of event-based convolutional layers
  to direct exploration. These layers rely on Gaussian dropouts and are inserted between
  the layers of the deep neural network model to help facilitate variational Thompson
  sampling. We empirically show the effectiveness of EVaDE-equipped Simulated Policy
  Learning (EVaDE-SimPLe) on the 100K Atari game suite.
