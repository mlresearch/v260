abstract: Ensuring fairness is essential when implementing machine learning models
  in practical applications. However, recent research has revealed that benchmark
  datasets can be crafted as fake evidence of fairness from unfair models using a
  method called Stealthily Biased Sampling (SBS). SBS minimizes the Wasserstein distance
  to manipulate a fake benchmark so that the distribution of the benchmark closely
  resembles the true data distribution. This optimization requires superquadratic
  time relative to the dataset size, making SBS applicable only to small-sized datasets.
  In this study, we reveal for the first time that the risk of manipulated benchmark
  datasets exists even for large-sized datasets. This finding indicates the necessity
  of considering the potential for manipulated benchmarks regardless of their size.
  To demonstrate this risk, we developed FastSBS, a computationally efficient variant
  of SBS using the Sliced Wasserstein distance. FastSBS is optimized by a stochastic
  gradient-based method, which requires only nearly linear time for each update. In
  experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that FastSBS is
  an order of magnitude faster than the original SBS for large datasets while maintaining
  the quality of the manipulated benchmark.
