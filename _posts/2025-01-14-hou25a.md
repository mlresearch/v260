abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation
  has become a challenging new research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures,
  so it is crucial to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and includes all
  necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained
  text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators, but they often lack
  rich geometric constraint information within the scene, leading to geometric distortion
  in the generated results. Therefore, we propose a two-stage geometry-aware progressive
  scene generation framework, SceneWeaver, which creates diverse, high-quality 3D
  scenes from text or image inputs. In the first stage, we introduce a multi-level
  depth refinement mechanism combined with image inpainting and point cloud updating
  strategies to construct a high-quality initial point cloud. In the second stage,
  3D Gaussians are initialized based on the point cloud and continuously optimized.
  To address the challenge of insufficient geometric constraints in the Gaussian Splatting
  optimization process, we utilize the rich appearance and geometry information within
  the scene to perform a geometry-aware optimization, resulting in high-quality scene
  generation results. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate
  the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several
  baselines.
