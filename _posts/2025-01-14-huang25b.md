abstract: We present a differentially private learner for half-spaces over a finite
  domain $\mathcal{X}^d\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$ with sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d\cdot\log^*\vert\mathcal{X}\vert)$,
  which improves over $\tilde{O}(d^{2.5}\cdot 8^{\log^*\vert\mathcal{X}\vert})$, the
  state-of-the-art result of [Kaplan et al., 2020]. The building block of our result
  is a novel differentially private algorithm that learns half-spaces by iteratively
  learning thresholds on angles.
