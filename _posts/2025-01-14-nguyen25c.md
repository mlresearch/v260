abstract: "Prompt learning methods are gaining increasing attention due to their ability
  to customize large vision-language models to new domains using pre-trained contextual
  knowledge and minimal training data. However, existing works typically rely on optimizing
  unified prompt\r inputs, often struggling with fine-grained classification tasks
  due to insufficient discriminative attributes. To tackle this, we consider a new
  framework based on a dual context of both domain-shared and class-specific contexts,
  where the latter is generated by Large\r Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs. Such
  dual prompt methods enhance the model’s feature representation by joining implicit
  and explicit factors encoded in LLM knowledge. Moreover, we formulate the Unbalanced
  Optimal Transport (UOT) theory to quantify the\r relationships between constructed
  prompts and visual tokens. Through partial matching, UOT can properly align discrete
  sets of visual tokens and prompt embeddings under different mass distributions,
  which is particularly valuable for handling irrelevant or noisy\r elements, ensuring
  that the preservation of mass does not restrict transport solutions. Furthermore,
  UOT’s characteristics integrate seamlessly with image augmentation, expanding the
  training sample pool while maintaining a reasonable distance between perturbed images
  and prompt inputs. Extensive experiments across few-shot classification and adapter
  settings substantiate the superiority of our model over current state-of-the-art
  baselines."
