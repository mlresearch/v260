abstract: Generating executable code through natural language instructions to drive
  robotic movements is considered a crucial step towards achieving embodied intelligence.
  However, in the robotics domain, the scarcity of programming language data often
  necessitates manually encapsulating high-level APIs to enable Large Language Models(LLMs)
  to predict code correctly, which is time-consuming and incomplete. Therefore, this
  paper proposes a three-stage Middle Code Prediction(MCP) scheme, by injecting appropriate
  prompts at different stages, the LLMs can shift towards predicting middle code that
  it understands more easily. This middle code can then be converted into the final
  code through specific scripts, accomplishing the task of generating code in uncommon
  programming languages automatically and without the need for manually encapsulating
  high-level APIs. We tested our approach on Hospital Item Transport Dataset(HITD)
  and found that MCP could improve the mean accuracy of various baseline models to
  varying degrees, with an overall increase of 31%, while also enhancing the noise
  resistance of fine-tuned models. We conducted real-world experiments on industrial
  robotic arms, verifying the feasibility of MCP in scenarios with no API and partial
  API encapsulation. The method proposed in this paper provides a guideline for code
  generation in uncommon programming languages within the context of LLMs. Our experimental
  dataset is available at https://github.com/Ghbbbbb/MCP.
