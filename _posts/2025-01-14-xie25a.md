abstract: "Multivariate Time Series (MTS) forecasting involves analyzing the evolution
  and interrelationships of multiple variables over time.\r Effectively mining relationships
  between MTS variables remains challenging as variables may imply multiple relational
  patterns. Recently, graph-based approaches have exhibited substantial effectiveness
  in capturing relationships between MTS variables. However, these methods often adhere
  to the paradigm of capturing low-level pairwise relationships, which limits their
  ability to capture other high-level beyond pair-wise relational patterns. To address
  this issue, we present a synergistic graph learning framework that combines the
  modeling advantages of graphs and hypergraphs to uncover more comprehensive relational
  patterns. This framework mainly consists of two parts. Firstly, we introduced a
  Synergistic Relation Construction module, which incorporates dynamic graph and hypergraph
  structures to model low-level pairwise and high-level beyond pairwise relationships
  among variables, representing multi-level relational patterns through obtained adjacency
  matrices and incidence metrics. Additionally, we developed a Synergistic Relation
  Learning mechanism, that leverages novel synergistic graph and hypergraph convolutional
  networks to facilitate spatial dependency interactions across multi-levels, along
  with temporal convolutional networks to capture more comprehensive spatial-temporal
  dependencies. We conducted comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets,
  and experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art
  performance. The source code will be available online."
