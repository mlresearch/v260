abstract: Understanding the meaning of infant cries is a significant challenge for
  young parents in caring for their newborns. The presence of background noise and
  the lack of labeled data present practical challenges in developing systems that
  can detect crying and analyze its underlying reasons. In this paper, we present
  a novel data-driven framework, “InfantCryNet,” for accomplishing these tasks. To
  address the issue of data scarcity, we employ pre-trained audio models to incorporate
  prior knowledge into our model. We propose the use of statistical pooling and multi-head
  attention pooling techniques to extract features more effectively. Additionally,
  knowledge distillation and model quantization are applied to enhance model efficiency
  and reduce the model size, better supporting industrial deployment in mobile devices.
  Experiments on real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed
  framework, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 4.4% in classification accuracy.
  The model compression effectively reduces the model size by 7% without compromising
  performance and by up to 28% with only an 8% decrease in accuracy, offering practical
  insights for model selection and system design.
