abstract: "Dynamic Graph Transformers (DGTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
  in various applications, such as social networks, traffic forecasting, and recommendation
  systems. Despite their effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies, training
  DGTs for large graphs remains a challenge. Mini-batch training is usually used to
  alleviate this challenge but this approach often fails to capture complex dependencies
  or sacrifice performance. \r To deal with the above problems, we propose the $\\underline{A}$daptive
  Node $\\underline{S}$ampling in $\\underline{H}$ierarchical $\\underline{D}$ynamic
  $\\underline{G}$raph $\\underline{T}$ransformers (ASH-DGT) architecture that focuses
  on sampling the set of suitable nodes preserving spatial-temporal relationships
  in the dynamic graph for training DGTs.\r Unlike previous methods that use random
  sampling or structural sampling, our motivation is that the contribution of nodes
  to learning performance can be time-sensitive, while we still care about spatial
  correlation in the dynamic graph with consideration to the global and local structure
  of the graph. \r Through extensive evaluations on popular real-world datasets for
  node classification and link prediction, ASH-DGT consistently outperforms multiple
  state-of-the-art methods, achieving both higher accuracy and significant improvements
  in training efficiency."
