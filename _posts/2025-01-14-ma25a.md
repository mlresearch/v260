abstract: Fake news detection has become a hot research topic in the multimodal domain.
  Existing multimodal fake news detection research utilizes a series of feature fusion
  networks to gather useful information from different modalities of news posts. However,
  how to form effective cross-modal features? And how cross-modal correlations impact
  decision-making? These remain open questions. This paper introduces MMFND, a multi-task
  guided multimodal fusion framework for fake news detection , which introduces multi-task
  modules for feature refinement and fusion. Pairwise CLIP encoders are used to extract
  modality-aligned deep representations, enabling accurate measurement of cross-modal
  correlations. Enhancing feature fusion by weighting multimodal features with normalised
  cross-modal correlations. Extensive experiments on typical fake news datasets demonstrate
  that MMFND outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
