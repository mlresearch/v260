abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of neural network technology,
  the application of deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence has made
  significant progress and improvement. However, during the training of neural network
  models, the utilization of datasets is involved, and these datasets may contain
  sensitive information from users. Attackers might exploit the well-trained models
  to gain access to this sensitive information, leading to privacy breaches. Considering
  this risk, some deep learning algorithms incorporate differential privacy technology
  to safeguard the privacy of the trained model. This protection comes at the cost
  of certain model performance, achieved by adding controllable random noise. In this
  paper, we propose a differential privacy deep learning algorithm based on the importance
  of each layer’s gradients, called DP-AdamILG. DP-AdamILG further mitigates the impact
  of noise addition on model performance. It accomplishes this by combining the dynamic
  privacy budget allocation strategy with the formation of noise gradients based on
  the importance of each layer’s gradients. And the algorithm’s privacy is theoretically
  proven. Experimental results show that the DP-AdamILG algorithm can reach good performance
  of the neural network model and show strong robustness.
