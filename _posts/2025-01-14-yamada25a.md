abstract: Model merging is attracting attention as a novel method for creating a new
  model by combining the weights of different trained models. While previous studies
  reported that model merging works well for models trained on a single dataset with
  different random seeds, model merging between different datasets remains unsolved.
  In this paper, we attempt to reveal the difficulty in merging such models trained
  on different datasets and alleviate it. Our empirical analyses show that, in contrast
  to the single-dataset scenarios, dataset information needs to be accessed to achieve
  high accuracy when merging models trained on different datasets. However, the requirement
  to use full datasets not only incurs significant computational costs but also becomes
  a major limitation when integrating models developed and shared by others. To address
  this, we demonstrate that dataset reduction techniques, such as coreset selection
  and dataset condensation, effectively reduce the data requirement for model merging.
  In our experiments with SPLIT-CIFAR10 model merging, the accuracy is significantly
  improved by $31$% when using the full dataset and $24$% when using the sampled subset
  compared with not using the dataset.  Our code is available at https://github.com/MasanoriYamada/re-basin-merge-pytorch.
