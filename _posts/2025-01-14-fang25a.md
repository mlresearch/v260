abstract: Multilingual pre-trained models have been widely applied in natural language
  processing (NLP) tasks, including text classification. However, due to the varying
  amounts of language resources, these models exhibit performance imbalance across
  different languages, a phenomenon known as language imbalance. Existing research
  on mitigating language imbalance primarily harnesses text and image data, neglecting
  the auditory aspects of languages. This neglect results in an incomplete solution
  to language imbalance, as it fails to exploit the rich linguistic nuances conveyed
  through speech. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel framework
  called MultiLingual Contrastive Learning (MLCL) to reduce language imbalance. By
  incorporating concepts from comparative linguistics into neural networks, we utilize
  the phonetic similarities among languages within the Sino-Tibetan family to tackle
  the problem of language imbalance in multilingual pre-trained models.  To evaluate
  our methodâ€™s effectiveness, we conducted tests using two synthetic datasets derived
  from the Flores200 and mms datasets across various models. The experimental results
  show that, in terms of language imbalance metrics, our model surpasses all baseline
  models.
