abstract: The task of multi-hop link prediction within knowledge graphs (KGs) stands
  as a challenge in the field of knowledge graph analysis, as it requires the model
  to reason through and understand all intermediate connections before making a prediction.
  In this paper, we introduce the Knowledge Graph Large Language Model (KG-LLM), a
  novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for knowledge graph
  tasks. We first convert structured knowledge graph data into natural language and
  then use these natural language prompts to fine-tune LLMs to enhance multi-hop link
  prediction in KGs. By converting the KG to natural language prompts, our framework
  is designed to learn the latent representations of entities and their interrelations.
  To show the efficacy of the KG-LLM Framework, we fine-tune three leading LLMs within
  this framework, including Flan-T5, LLaMa2 and Gemma. Further, we explore the framework’s
  potential to provide LLMs with zero-shot capabilities for handling previously unseen
  prompts. Experimental results show that KG-LLM significantly improves the models’
  generalization capabilities, leading to more accurate predictions in unfamiliar
  scenarios.
