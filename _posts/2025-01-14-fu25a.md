abstract: Small object detection (SOD) aims to precisely localize and accurately classify
  objects from limited spatial extent and discernible features. Despite significant
  advancements in object detection driven by CNN-based and Transformer-based methods,
  SOD remains a significant challenge. This is primarily due to their minimal spatial
  dimensions and distinct features which pose difficulties in both computational efficiency
  and effective supervision. Particularly, Transformer-based detectors suffer from
  the high computational cost caused by the introduction of a feature pyramid network
  (FPN) and the sparse supervision for the encoder output due to insufficient positive
  queries. Current approaches attempt to mitigate these issues through sparse attention
  mechanisms and auxiliary one-to-many label assignment strategies. However, these
  approaches often still suffer from inefficiencies in processing multi-scale information
  and a deficiency in generating adequate positive queries for small objects. To address
  this issue, we propose a novel small object detector MRQM, which integrates Multi-scale
  Refinement and Query-aided Mining. The scale-aware encoder strategically refines
  features across multiple scales from a bi-directional feature pyramid network (BiFPN)
  through iterative updates. This process not only reduces redundant computations
  but also significantly enhances the representation of features at various scales.
  Furthermore, the IoU-aware head integrates the dynamic anchors mining strategy and
  one-to-many label assignments to fully mine potential high-quality auxiliary positive
  queries for small instances, and mitigate issues related to sparse supervision for
  the encoder. Extensive experiments on the SODA-D and VisDrone datasets consistently
  demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our MRQM method.
