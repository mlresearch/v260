abstract: Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) endeavors to analyze four sentiment
  elements in sentences. Recent studies utilize generative models to achieve this
  task, yielding commendable outcomes. However, these studies often fall short of
  fully leveraging the relationships between sentiment elements and have difficulty
  effectively handling implicit sentiment expressions. Furthermore, this task also
  confronts the obstacle of data scarcity stemming from the substantial expenses involved
  in data annotation. To address these limitations, we propose dual-sequence data
  augmentation to achieve diverse input and target expressions, while we incorporate
  contrastive learning to instigate the model to distinctly represent the presence
  or absence of these pivotal features pertaining to implicit aspects and opinion
  terms. Additionally, we introduce a prediction normalization strategy to refine
  the produced results. Empirical findings from experiments on four publicly available
  datasets show the superiority of our method, surpassing multiple baseline approaches
  and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark.
