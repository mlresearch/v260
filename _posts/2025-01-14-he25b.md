abstract: Diffusion model-based low-light image enhancement methods rely heavily on
  paired training data, which limits its extensive application. Meanwhile, existing
  unsupervised methods lack effective bridging capabilities for unknown degradation.
  To address these limitations, we firstly propose a novel zero-reference lighting
  estimation diffusion model for low-light image enhancement called Zero-LED. It utilizes
  the stable convergence ability of diffusion models to bridge the gap between low-light
  domains and real normal-light domains and successfully alleviates the dependence
  on pairwise training data via zero-reference learning. Specifically, we first design
  the initial optimization network to preprocess the input image and implement bidirectional
  constraints between the diffusion model and the initial optimization network through
  multiple objective functions. Subsequently, the degradation factors of the real-world
  scene are optimized iteratively to achieve effective light enhancement. In addition,
  we explore a frequency-domain based and semantically guided appearance reconstruction
  module that encourages feature alignment of the recovered image at a fine-grained
  level and satisfies subjective expectations. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate
  the superiority of our approach to other state-of-the-art methods and more significant
  generalization capabilities.
