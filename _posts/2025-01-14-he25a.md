abstract: Previous works on Textbook Question Answering suffer from limited performance
  due to the small-scale neural network based backbone. To alleviate the issue, we
  propose to utilize LLMs as the backbone of TQA tasks. To this end, we utilize two
  methods, the raw-context based prompting method and the knowledge graph based prompting
  method. Specifically, we introduce the Textbook Question Answering-Knowledge Graph
  (TQA-KG) method, which first converts textbook content into structural knowledge
  graphs and then combining knowledge graph into LLM prompting, thereby enhancing
  the modelâ€™s reasoning capabilities and answer accuracy. Extensive experiments conducted
  on the CK12-QA dataset illustrate the effectiveness of the method, achieving an
  improvement of 5.67% in accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art methods on
  average.
