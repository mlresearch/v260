abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are known to suffer from degraded performance
  with more layers. Most prior works explained it from graph propagation, arguing
  that it inevitably leads to indistinguishable node features under more depth, known
  as *oversmoothing*. However, we notice that these analyses largely ignore the role
  of GNN weights either directly or by unrealistically strong assumptions. In this
  paper, we rediscover the role of GNN weights on oversmoothing with a systematic
  study. Notably, contrary to previous findings, we show that when learned freely,
  there always exist ideal weights such that vanilla GNNs completely avoid oversmoothing,
  even after infinite propagation steps. It indicates that oversmoothing is a problem
  of learning disabilities instead of the doom of GNNs themselves. To facilitate the
  learning of proper weights, we propose Weight Reparameterization (**WeightRep**)
  as a way to adaptively maintain the ideal weights in vanilla GNNs along the learning
  process. We theoretically show that for linear GNNs, WeightRep can always mitigate
  oversmoothing (full collapse) as well as dimensional collapse. Extensive experiments
  on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in practice.
