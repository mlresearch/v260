abstract: We present a new convergence analysis for the over-relaxed alternating direction
  method of multipliers (ADMM) when the subproblem cannot be exactly solved, \ie,
  inexact over-relaxed ADMM. Our method builds on \citep{hu2017dissipativity} that
  relates the convergence analysis of optimization algorithms to the stability of
  a discrete-time linear dynamic system. By expressing the inexact over-relaxed ADMM
  as a discrete-time linear dynamic system, we show that both the linear and sublinear
  convergence of inexact over-relaxed ADMM can be obtained by solving or verifying
  the feasibility of a small semidefinite program (SDP). More importantly, we prove
  that the associated SDP has an analytical solution for various parameters. We demonstrate
  the theoretical result by applying the inexact over-relaxed ADMM to solve a distributed
  $\ell_1$-norm regularized logistic regression problem.
