abstract: 'Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) is a task that identifies spoken
  words by analyzing both lip movements and auditory signals. Compared to Automatic
  Speech Recognition (ASR), AVSR demonstrates greater robustness in noisy environments
  due to the support of dual modalities. However, the inherent differences between
  these modalities present a challenge: effectively accounting for their disparities
  and leveraging their complementary information to extract useful information for
  AVSR. To address this, we propose the AMG-AVSR model, which utilizes a two-stage
  curriculum learning strategy and incorporates a feature compression and recovery
  mechanism. By leveraging the characteristics of different modalities in various
  scenarios to guide each other, the model extracts refined features from audio-visual
  data, thereby enhancing recognition performance in both clean and noisy environments.
  Compared to the baseline model AV-HuBERT, AMG-AVSR demonstrates superior performance
  on the LRS2 dataset in both noisy and clean environments. AMG-AVSR achieves a word
  error rate (WER) of 2.9% under clean speech conditions. In various noisy conditions,
  AMG-AVSR shows a significant reduction in WER compared to previous methods.'
