abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) stands as a powerful technique utilized for training
  models to capture semantic similarities between data points across various domains,
  including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
  Current approaches in DML often prioritize the development of novel network structures
  or loss functions while overlooking metric properties and the intricate relationship
  between classification and metric learning. This oversight results in significant
  time overhead, particularly when the number of categories increases. To address
  this challenge, we propose extending the loss function used in classification to
  function as a metric, thereby imposing constraints on the distances between training
  samples based on the triangle inequality. This approach is akin to proxy-based methods
  and aims to enhance the efficiency of DML. Drawing inspiration from metrically convex
  metrics, we introduce the concept of a "weak-metric" to overcome the limitations
  associated with certain loss functions that cannot be straightforwardly extended
  to full metrics. This ensures the effectiveness of DML under various circumstances.
  Furthermore, we extend the Cross Entropy loss function to function as a weak-metric
  and introduce a novel metric loss derived from Cross Entropy for experimental comparisons
  with other methods. The results underscore the credibility and reliability of our
  proposal, showcasing its superiority over state-of-the-art techniques. Notably,
  our approach also exhibits significantly faster training times as the number of
  categories increases, making it a compelling choice for large-scale datasets.
