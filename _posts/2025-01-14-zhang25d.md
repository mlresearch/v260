abstract: Unlearning methods that rely solely on forgetting data typically modify
  the network’s decision boundary to achieve unlearning. However, these approaches
  are susceptible to the "relearning" problem, whereby the network may recall the
  forgotten class upon subsequent updates with the remaining class data. Our experimental
  analysis reveals that, although these modifications alter the decision boundary,
  the network’s fundamental perception of the samples remains mostly unchanged. In
  response to the relearning problem, we introduce the Perception Revising Unlearning
  (PRU) framework. PRU employs a probability redistribution method, which assigns
  new labels and more precise supervision information to each forgetting class instance.
  The PRU actively shifts the network’s perception of forgetting class samples toward
  other remaining classes. The experimental results demonstrate that PRU not only
  has good classification effectiveness but also significantly reduces the risk of
  relearning, suggesting a robust approach to class unlearning tasks that depend solely
  on forgetting data.
