abstract: Federated learning for training machine learning models across geographically
  distributed regional centers is becoming prevalent. However, because of disparities
  in location, latency, and computational capabilities, synchronously aggregating
  models across different sites requires waiting for stragglers, leading to significant
  delays. Traditional asynchronous aggregation across regional centers still faces
  issues of stale model parameters and outdated gradients due to the hierarchical
  aggregation involving local clients within each center. To address this, we propose
  Hierarchical Global Asynchronous Federated Learning (HGA-FL), which combines global
  asynchronous model aggregation across regional centers with synchronous aggregation
  and local consistent regularization alignment within each local center. We theoretically
  analyze the convergence rate of our method under non-convex optimization settings,
  demonstrating its stable convergence during the aggregation. Experimental evaluations
  show that our approach outperforms other baseline two-level aggregation methods
  in terms of global model generalization ability, particularly under conditions of
  data heterogeneity, latency, and gradient staleness.
