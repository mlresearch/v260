abstract: Recent studies have exposed the substantial vulnerability of voice-activated
  smart devices to adversarial examples, predominantly targeting the robustness of
  automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Most of adversarial examples generated
  by introducing adversarial perturbations within the $l_p$ norm bounds to benign
  audio inputs. However, these attacks are constrained by the parametric bounds of
  perturbations or the features of disturbance, which limits their effectiveness.
  To improve the acoustic realism of adversarial examples and enhance attack performance,
  we propose a novel attack framework called Diffusion-based Adversarial Attack, leveraging
  DiffVC, a diffusion-based voice conversion model, to map audio to a latent space
  and employing Adversarial Latent Perturbation (ALP) to embed less perceptible and
  more robust perturbations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances
  targeted attack performance. Notably, the Word Error Rate (WER) has shown an average
  increase of 101 absolute points over clean speech audio and 25 absolute points over
  C&W attack. Additionally, the Success Rate (SR) has achieved an average increase
  of 11 absolute points over the C&W attack and 16 absolute points over SSA attack.
  Additionally, our approach also stands out for its high audio quality and efficiency.
