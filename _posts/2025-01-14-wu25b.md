abstract: We propose a new multiple instance learning (MIL) method called Causal ATTention
  Multiple Instance Learning (CATTMIL) to alleviate the dataset bias for more accurate
  classification of whole slide images (WSIs). There are different kinds of dataset
  bias due to confounders that are rooted in data generation and/or pre-training dataset
  of MIL. Confounders might mislead MIL models to learn spurious correlations between
  instances and bag label. Such spurious correlations, in turn, impede the generalization
  ability of models and hurt the final performance. To fight against the negative
  impacts of confounders, CATTMIL exploits the causal intervention using the front-door
  adjustment with a Causal ATTention (CATT) mechanism. This enables CATTMIL to remove
  the spurious correlations so as to estimate the causal effect of instances on the
  bag label. Unlike previous deconfounded MIL methods, our CATTMIL does not need to
  approximate confounder values. Therefore, CATTMIL is able to bring further performance
  boosting to existing schemes and achieve the state-of-the-art in WSI classification.
  Extensive experiments on classification of the two widely-used datasets of TCGA-NSCLC
  and CAMELYON16 show CATTMILâ€™s effectiveness in suppressing the dataset bias and
  enhancing the generalization capability as well.
