abstract: "This paper introduces DataFrame question answering (QA), a novel task that
  utilizes natural language processing (NLP) models to generate Pandas queries for
  information retrieval and data analysis on dataframes, emphasizing safe and non-revealing
  data handling. Specifically, our method, leveraging large language model (LLM),
  which solely relies on dataframe column names, not only ensures data privacy but
  also significantly reduces the context window in the prompt, streamlining information
  processing and addressing major challenges in LLM-based data analysis. We propose
  DataFrame QA as a comprehensive framework that includes safe Pandas query generation
  and code execution.\r Various LLMs are evaluated on the renowned WikiSQL dataset
  and our newly developed UCI-DataFrameQA, tailored for complex data analysis queries.
  Our findings indicate that GPT-4 performs well on both datasets, underscoring its
  capability in securely retrieving and aggregating dataframe values and conducting
  sophisticated data analyses. This approach, deployable in a zero-shot manner without
  prior training or adjustments, proves to be highly adaptable and secure for diverse
  applications.\r Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/JunyiYe/dataframe-qa."
