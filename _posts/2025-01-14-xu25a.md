abstract: The video face restoration aims to restore high-quality face video from
  low-quality face video, but most existing methods typically focus on specific and
  single degradation scene such as denoising or deblurring. However, the universal
  video face restoration should restore face video in various degradation scenes.
  In this paper, we use language prompt which describes the face information including
  gender, appearance and expression to guide video face restoration. To enhance the
  applicability, we remove the language prompt by ControlNet and incorporate the human-level
  knowledge from vision-language models into general networks to improve the video
  face restoration performance and enable the universal video face restoration. In
  addition, we construct a degradation dataset, which contains multiple degradations
  in the same scene and captions which describe the face information. Our extensive
  experiments show that our approach achieves highly competitive performance in universal
  video face restoration.
