abstract: "Analyzing time-series data that may contain personal information, particularly
  in the medical field, presents serious privacy concerns. Sensitive health data from
  patients is often used to train machine-learning models for diagnostics and ongoing
  care. Assessing the privacy risk of such models is crucial to making knowledgeable
  decisions on whether to use a model in production, share it with third parties,
  or deploy it in patientsâ€™ homes. Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) are a key method
  for this kind of evaluation, however time-series prediction models have not been
  thoroughly studied in this context.\r We explore existing MIA techniques on time-series
  models, and introduce new features, focusing on the seasonality and trend components
  of the data. Seasonality is estimated using a multivariate Fourier transform, and
  a low-degree polynomial is used to approximate trends. We applied these techniques
  to various types of time-series models, using datasets from the health domain. Our
  results demonstrate that these new features enhance the effectiveness of MIAs in
  identifying membership, improving the understanding of privacy risks in medical
  data applications."
