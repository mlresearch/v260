abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sparsify neural networks by transforming
  them into implicit models characterized by an equilibrium equation rather than the
  conventional hierarchical layer structure. Unlike traditional sparsification techniques
  reliant on network structure or specific loss functions, our method simplifies the
  process to a simple constrained least-squared problem with sparsity-inducing constraints
  or penalties. Additionally, we introduce a scalable algorithm that can be parallelized,
  addressing the computational complexities associated with this transformation while
  maintaining efficiency. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 and 20NewsGroup datasets
  demonstrate the high effectiveness of our method, particularly in scenarios with
  high pruning rates. This approach offers a versatile and efficient solution for
  neural network parameter reduction. Furthermore, we observe that a moderate subset
  of the training data suffices to achieve competitive performance, highlighting the
  robustness and information-capturing capability of our approach.
