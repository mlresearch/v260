abstract: "Saliency maps are one of the most popular tools to interpret the operation
  of a neural network: they compute input features deemed relevant to the final prediction,
  which are often subsets of pixels that are easily understandable by a human being.
  However, it is known that relying solely on human assessment to judge a saliency
  map method can be misleading.\r In this work, we propose a new neural network verification
  specification called saliency-robustness, which aims to use formal methods to prove
  a relationship between Vanilla Gradient (VG) – a simple yet surprisingly effective
  saliency map method – and the network’s prediction: given a network, if an input
  $x$ emits a certain VG saliency map, it is mathematically proven (or disproven)
  that the network must classify $x$ in a certain way.\r We then introduce a novel
  method that combines both Marabou and Crown – two state-of-the-art neural network
  verifiers, to solve the proposed specification. Experiments on our synthetic dataset
  and MNIST show that Vanilla Gradient is surprisingly effective as a certification
  for the predicted output."
