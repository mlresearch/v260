abstract: Similar case retrieval is a crucial aspect of the legal retrieval field,
  significantly contributing to LegalAI systems. This task aims to retrieve cases
  that are highly relevant to the query case, thereby enhancing the efficiency of
  legal practitioners. Recent methods have leveraged the rich semantic knowledge of
  pre-trained models, greatly improving retrieval performance. However, these methods
  often overlook key legal elements within the complex language structures of case
  texts, such as legal event information that can impact case outcomes and judgments.
  This oversight results in the underutilization of critical case information. To
  address this issue, we proposed RAEvent, a similar case retrieval contrastive framework
  augmented by legal event information. This framework utilizes an enhanced case event
  information database to provide auxiliary information for case retrieval and employs
  contrastive learning techniques to better extract similar features in cases. In
  comparison to a range of baseline approaches, the results of our experiments highlight
  the efficacy of our framework. Moreover, our research provides fresh perspectives
  and makes a valuable contribution to the ongoing studies in similar case retrieval
  tasks.
