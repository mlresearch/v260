abstract: Compared with natural images, the target of a single-frame infrared small
  target image occupies fewer pixels, has fuzzy imaging, less shape and texture information,
  and a more complex background. This leads to lower detection accuracy and makes
  it difficult to achieve accurate target localization. Therefore, in this paper,
  an infrared small target detection algorithm, IST-YOLO, is proposed based on yolov8.
  First, our algorithm improves the structure of standard model by adding an upsampling
  layer and a higher resolution detection head, which has a better ability to detect
  small targets. Second, we designed the Adaptive Residual Module (ARM) by combining
  the residual structure with the frequency adaptive dilated convolution to enhance
  the capacity of extracting deep small target position information while retaining
  the rich semantic information in the shallow layers. Finally, the Local and Globa
  Fusion (LGFusion) module is designed to enhance the information interaction between
  local and global features of the model. Experiments show that the accuracy of IST-YOLO
  outperforms both standard and popular algorithms.
