abstract: The global shortage of mental health resources has severely impacted the
  ability to address psychological distress, affecting approximately 658 million people.
  Despite the effectiveness of psychotherapy and counseling, less than 35% of those
  in need receive help. Traditional conversational agents often lack emotional support,
  leading to mechanical interactions that detract from user experience. This paper
  introduces the "Mental Health Chatbot," a conversational agent based on a pre-trained
  large language model. This chatbot innovatively uses retrieval-augmentation techniques
  to extract relevant knowledge from psychological diagnostics and treatment manuals,
  providing tailored psychotherapeutic interventions. It effectively identifies mental
  disorders and their severity, suggesting appropriate interventions. Evaluated through
  pre-trained model similarity comparisons, large language model scoring, and expert
  assessments, results show that the Mental Health Chatbot enhances the accuracy of
  smaller models and accelerates the inference speed of larger models through retrieval-augmentation.
  The optimized training process enables more human-like interactions, improving user
  experience and demonstrating the chatbotâ€™s potential and practical application in
  addressing mental health challenges.
