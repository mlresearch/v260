abstract: In combinatorial causal bandits (CCB), the learning agent chooses a subset
  of variables in each round to intervene and collects feedback from the observed
  variables to minimize expected regret or sample complexity. Previous works study
  this problem in both general causal models and binary generalized linear models
  (BGLMs). However, all of them require prior knowledge of causal graph structure
  or unrealistic assumptions. This paper studies the CCB problem without the graph
  structure on binary general causal models and BGLMs. We first provide an exponential
  lower bound of cumulative regrets for the CCB problem on general causal models.
  To overcome the exponentially large space of parameters, we then consider the CCB
  problem on BGLMs. We design a regret minimization algorithm for BGLMs even without
  the graph skeleton and show that it still achieves $O(\sqrt{T}\ln T)$ expected regret,
  as long as the causal graph satisfies a weight gap assumption. This asymptotic regret
  is the same as the state-of-art algorithms relying on the graph structure. Moreover,
  we propose another algorithm with $O(T^{\frac{2}{3}}\ln T)$ regret to remove the
  weight gap assumption.
