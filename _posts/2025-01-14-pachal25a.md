abstract: "Sequential Prediction in presence of missing data is an old research problem.
  Classically,\r researchers have tackled this by imputing data first and then building
  predictive models.\r This 2-stage process is typically prone to errors and to circumvent
  this, researchers have\r provided a variety of techniques which employ a joint impute
  and learn approach before\r prediction. Among these, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  have been very popular given\r their natural ability to tackle sequential data efficiently.
  Existing state-of-art approaches\r either (i)do not impute (ii) do not completely
  factor the available information around a gap,\r (iii)ignore position information
  within a gap and so on. Our approach intelligently addresses\r these gaps by proposing
  a novel architecture which jointly imputes and learns by taking\r into account (i)information
  from either end of the gap (ii)proximity to the left/right-end of\r a gap (iii)the
  length of the gap. In context of this work, prediction means either sequence\r classification
  or forecasting. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed\r architecture
  on forecasting tasks. We benchmark against a range of state-of-art baselines\r and
  in scenarios where data is either (a)naturally missing or (b)synthetically masked."
