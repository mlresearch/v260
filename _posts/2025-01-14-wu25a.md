abstract: 'Automatic license plate recognition is applied widely in life, but it is
  still a challenging task in open scenarios. The current ALPR methods require multiple
  recognitions in multi-license plate scenarios. Furthermore, they have complex recognition
  structures and insufficient recognition capabilities for multi-style license plates.
  To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a single-stage multi-style multi-license
  plate recognition method based on the attention mechanism: CLPRNet. We use a spatial
  attention module based on UNet to separate the license plate character sequence
  into each attention heatmap in order. This approach unifies license plates with
  different character lengths and different character rows into a single processing
  logic, thereby enabling CLPRNet to recognize multiple styles without additional
  style judgement branches. At the same time, we abandon the traditional method of
  cropping RoI from image or feature, and instead combine attention to recognize characters
  directly, which allows CLPRNet to recognize multiple license plates in a single
  pass. To address the issue of an inadequate number of multi-style license plate
  samples, this paper also proposes a multi-style license plate generation method.
  In the single-stage methods, CLPRNet demonstrates better detection performance on
  the CCPD dataset and better recognition performance on the FN, Rotate, and Tilt
  subsets of the CCPD dataset. Compared with the existing license plate recognition
  methods, CLPRNet can recognize more styles of license plates. Test results and ablation
  experiments have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.'
