abstract: Recently, prompt-based learning has become popular in many Natural Language
  Processing (NLP) tasks by converting the task into a cloze-style one to smooth out
  the differences between Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and the current task.
  However, as for relation classification, it is challenging to associate the natural
  language word that fills in the mask token with relation labels due to the rich
  semantic information in textual label, e.g. ”org:founded_by”. To address this challenge,
  this paper presents a novel prompt-based learning method, namely LabelPrompt, for
  the relation classification task. It is an extraordinary intuitive approach motivated
  by “GIVE MODEL CHOICES!”. Specifically, we first define additional tokens to represent
  the relation labels, which regard these tokens as the verbalizer with semantic initialisation
  and explicitly construct them with a prompt template method. Then, we address the
  inconsistency between predicted relations and given entities by implementing an
  entity-aware module that employs contrastive learning. Last, we conduct an attention
  query strategy to differentiate prompt tokens and sequence tokens. These strategies
  effectively improve the adaptation capability of prompt-based learning, especially
  when only a small labelled dataset is available. Extensive experimental results
  obtained on several bench-marking datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method,
  particularly in the few-shot scenario. Our code can be found at \url{https://github.com/xerrors/Labelprompt}.
