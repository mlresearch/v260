abstract: "Random projections are a cornerstone of high-dimensional computations.
  However, their analysis has proven both difficult and inadequate in capturing the
  empirically observed accuracy. To bridge this gap, this paper studies random projections
  from a novel perspective, focusing on data-dependent, that is, \\emph{non-oblivious},
  performance.\r The key contribution is the precise and data-dependent accuracy analysis
  of Rademacher random projections, achieved through elegant geometric methods of
  independent interest, namely, \\emph{Schur-concavity}. The result formally states
  the following property: the less spread-out the data is, the better the accuracy.
  This leads to notable improvements in accuracy guarantees for data characterized
  by sparsity or distributed with a small spread.\r The key tool is a novel algebraic
  framework for proving Schur-concavity properties, which offers an alternative to
  derivative-based criteria commonly used in related studies. We demonstrate its value
  by providing an alternative proof for the extension of the celebrated Khintchine
  inequality."
