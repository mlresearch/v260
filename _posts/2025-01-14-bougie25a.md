abstract: 'Sparse rewards pose a significant challenge for many reinforcement learning
  algorithms, which struggle in the absence of a dense, well-shaped reward function.
  Drawing inspiration from the curiosity exhibited in animals, intrinsically-driven
  methods overcome this drawback by incentivizing agents to explore novel states.
  Yet, in the absence of domain-specific priors, sample efficiency is hindered as
  most discovered novelty has little relevance to the true task reward. We present
  iLLM, a curiosity-driven approach that leverages the inductive bias of foundation
  models â€” Large Language Models, as a source of information about plausibly useful
  behaviors. Two tasks are introduced for shaping exploration: 1) action generation
  and 2) history compression, where the language model is prompted with a description
  of the state-action trajectory. We further propose a technique for mapping state-action
  pairs to pretrained token embeddings of the language model in order to alleviate
  the need for explicit textual descriptions of the environment. By distilling prior
  knowledge from large language models, iLLM encourages agents to discover diverse
  and human-meaningful behaviors without requiring direct human intervention. We evaluate
  the proposed method on BabyAI-Text, MiniHack, Atari games, and Crafter tasks, demonstrating
  higher sample efficiency compared to prior curiosity-driven approaches.'
