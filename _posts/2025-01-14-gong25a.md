abstract: Contrastive learning has demonstrated great performance in breast cancer
  diagnosis. However, few existing works inspect label information in contrastive
  representation learning, especially for multi-modality ultrasound scenes. In this
  work, a two-stage supervised multi-modality contrastive representation classification
  network (TSMCR) is proposed for assisting breast cancer diagnosis on the multimodality
  ultrasound. TSMCR consists of two-stage supervised multimodality contrastive learning
  (SMCL) and deep support vector machine (DSVM). By a novel contrastive loss, SMCL  handles
  the consistency between modalities and the sample separability. Further, two-stage
  SMCL learns expressive representation by gradually pulling the similar samples of
  positive pairs closer and pushing the dissimilar samples of negative pairs apart
  in the projection space. Besides, on the fusion of the multi-level contrastive representation,
  DSVM is to jointly learn the representation network and classifier again in a unified
  framework to improve the generation performance. The experimental results on the
  multimodality ultrasound dataset show the proposed TSMCR achieves superior performance
  with an accuracy of 87.51%, sensitivity of 86.67%, and specificity of 88.36%.
