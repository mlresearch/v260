abstract: Learning in biological systems involves the intricate modeling of diverse
  entities and their interrelations, leading to the evolution of logical knowledge
  networks with accumulating experience. Analogously, knowledge graphs serve as semantic
  representations of entity relationships, playing a vital role in natural language
  processing and graph representation learning. However, contemporary knowledge graph
  embedding models often neglect real-world event updates, while existing continual
  knowledge graph research predominantly relies on conventional learning methods that
  inadequately leverage graph structure, thereby compromising their continual learning
  capabilities. This study introduces a novel Continual Mask Knowledge Graph Embedding
  framework (CMKGE), designed to address these limitations. CMKGE integrates semantic
  attributes, network structure, and continual learning mechanisms to capture the
  dynamic evolution of knowledge. Inspired by biological signal propagation and Dale’s
  principle, we introduce a dual-mask mechanism for neuronal inhibition and activation.
  This mechanism automatically filters critical old knowledge, enhancing model plasticity
  and stability. Through comprehensive evaluations on four datasets, we demonstrate
  CMKGE’s superiority over state-of-the-art continual embedding models.
