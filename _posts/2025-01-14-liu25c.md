abstract: "Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are vulnerable to deception through the
  intentional addition of imperceptible perturbations to benign examples, posing a
  significant threat to security-sensitive applications. To address this, understanding
  the underlying causes of this phenomenon is crucial for developing robust models.
  A key research area involves investigating the characteristics of adversarial directions,
  which have been found to be perpendicular to decision boundaries and associated
  with low-density regions of the data. Existing research primarily focuses on adversarial
  directions for individual examples, while decision boundaries and data distributions
  are inherently dataset-dependent. This paper explores the space of adversarial perturbations
  within a dataset. Specifically, we represent adversarial perturbations as a linear
  combination of adversarial directions, followed by a non-linear projection. Using
  the proposed greedy algorithm, we train the adversarial space spanned by the set
  of adversarial directions. \r Experiments on Cifar10 and ImageNet substantiate the
  existence of the adversarial space as an embedded space within the entire data space.
  Furthermore, the learned adversarial space enables statistical analysis of decision
  boundaries. Finally, we observe that the adversarial space learned on one DNN model
  is model-agnostic, and that the adversarial space learned on a vanilla model is
  a subset of that learned on a robust model, implicating data distribution as the
  underlying cause of adversarial examples."
