abstract: Microarray-generated genomic data has recently sparked a wave of bioinformatics
  and data mining research. However, such data presents significant challenges for
  further analysis due to its high dimensionality and small sample sizes. Feature
  selection is a standard approach to address this issue, as it can enhance classification
  performance while reducing dimensionality. This paper introduces an Improved Gray
  Wolf Optimization-based Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT-IGWO) feature selection approach
  tailored for high-dimensional classification. It adopts multi-population co-evolving
  searching modes that can be regarded as a typical feature selection task via a specific
  information-sharing mechanism. Within the proposed multitasking framework, both
  population diversity and global searching capabilities of EMT-IGWO are improved.
  Moreover, several enhancements are incorporated into the two searching modes to
  help stagnant individuals escape from local optima with higher probabilities. Computational
  results show that EMT-IGWO outperforms other compared algorithms in effectiveness
  and efficiency evaluated across eight public gene expression datasets.
