abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models and flow-based generative
  models, there has been a surge of interests in solving noisy linear inverse problems,
  e.g., super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, colorization, etc, with generative
  models. However, while remarkable reconstruction performances have been achieved,
  their inference time is typically too slow since most of them rely on the seminal
  diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) framework and thus to approximate the intractable
  likelihood score, time-consuming gradient calculation through back-propagation is
  needed. To address this issue, this paper provides a fast and effective solution
  by proposing a simple closed-form approximation to the likelihood score. For both
  diffusion and flow-based models, extensive experiments are conducted on various
  noisy linear inverse problems such as noisy super-resolution, denoising, deblurring,
  and colorization. In all these tasks, our method (namely DMPS) demonstrates highly
  competitive or even better reconstruction performances while being significantly
  faster than all the baseline methods.
