abstract: The field of research on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms
  in self-driving vehicles is rapidly expanding in mixed-traffic scenarios where autonomous
  vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist. Most studies assume that
  all AVs can obtain accurate state information. However, in real-world scenarios,
  noisy sensor measurements have a significant impact. To address this issue, we propose
  an effective and robust MARL algorithm Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization
  with Curriculum-based Adversarial Learning (CA-MAPPO) for situations where the observation
  perturbations are considered. The proposed approach incorporates adversarial samples
  during training and adopts a curriculum learning approach by gradually increasing
  the noise intensity. By evaluating the proposed approach in the ideal environment
  and scenarios under noise attacks with varying intensities, experiment results demonstrate
  that the proposed algorithm enables AVs to achieve a success rate of over 70% for
  the multi-lane highway on-ramp merging task, achieving a maximum average speed of
  up to over 19 $m/s$ and performing significantly better than the state-of-the-art
  MARL algorithms such as MAPPO and MAACKTR.
