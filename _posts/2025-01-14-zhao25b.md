abstract: Identifying the optimal query plan is always a fundamental task of query
  optimization in database management system (DBMS). However, traditional query optimization
  methods face significant challenges in continuously enhancing query performance
  due to complex query sentences, intricate data distributions and the exponentially
  growing search space of table joins. In this paper, we propose a formidable query
  optimization framework called MRQO (Integrating-MCTS-and-LTR-for-Query-Optimization).
  This framework utilizes the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to find a comprehensive
  set of join orders for a query, and uses these join orders as hints to generate
  corresponding query plans. Additionally, it employs the Learning-to-Rank (LTR) approach
  to train a relative ranking model, achieving higher efficiency and accuracy in identifying
  the optimal query plan from all plans. Experimental results on PostgreSQL demonstrate
  that the proposed MRQO can achieve stable performance and match or even outperform
  both traditional query optimizers and advanced learned optimizers based on Deep
  Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in terms of query optimization efficiency.
