abstract: Association as a gift enables people do not have to mention something in
  completely straightforward words and allows others to understand what they intend
  to refer to. In this paper, we propose a chain association-based adversarial attack
  against natural language processing systems, utilizing the comprehension gap between
  humans and machines. We first generate a chain association graph for Chinese characters
  based on the association paradigm for building search space of potential adversarial
  examples.  Then, we introduce an discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm
  to search for the optimal adversarial examples.  We conduct comprehensive experiments
  and show that advanced natural language processing models and applications, including
  large language models, are vulnerable to our attack, while humans appear good at
  understanding the perturbed text. We also explore two methods, including adversarial
  training and associative graph-based recovery, to shield systems from chain association-based
  attack. Since a few examples that use some derogatory terms, this paper contains
  materials that may be offensive or upsetting to some people.
