abstract: Commonsense reasoning (CSR) requires rationale beyond the explicit knowledge
  mentioned in the context. Many existing methods use knowledge graphs (KGs) to generate
  rationale as additional evidence for CSR. However, rationale extracted from KGs
  (e.g., ConceptNet) often includes irrelevant information, which easily introduces
  noise and affects the evidential quality generated. Similar to brainstorming to
  generate diverse ideas, we introduce a synonym expansion method to expand input
  concepts, ultimately constructing a task relevant knowledge subgraph. Additionally,
  we propose a pruning model that learns to score and prune the knowledge subgraph,
  removing parts that are not directly related to the input context. The  proposed
  method improves the quality and diversity of rationale, which benefits generative
  commonsense reasoning tasks. Experiments on two datasets validated the effectiveness
  of our method, which demonstrates comparable performance with existing methods.
