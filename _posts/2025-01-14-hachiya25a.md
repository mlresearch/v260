abstract: Seismic motion simulations enable high-precision predictions but are computationally
  demanding. This study introduces a deep learning surrogate model using the MLP-Mixer
  architecture to address this challenge. Traditional models using independent Multi-layer
  Perceptrons (MLPs) fail to capture spatial correlations, while U-shaped Neural Operators
  (U-NOs) require high computational costs for high-resolution inputs and outputs.
  Our proposed model, the Multiple MLP-Mixer (Multi-MLP-Mixer), integrates global
  and local spatial information through multiple MLP-Mixer blocks and dual patch-wise
  affine transformations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with simulation
  data from anticipated megathrust earthquakes in the Nankai Trough, achieving performance
  comparable to state-of-the-art models with significantly improved computational
  efficiency.
