abstract: Federated graph learning enhances federated learning by enabling privacy-preserving
  collaborative training on distributed graph data. While traditional methods are
  effective in managing data heterogeneity, they typically assume static graph structures,
  overlooking the dynamic nature of real-world graphs. Integrating federated graph
  learning with dynamic graph neural networks addresses this issue but often fails
  to retain previously acquired knowledge, limiting generalization for both global
  and personalized models. This paper proposes FedDGL, a novel framework designed
  to address temporal evolution , and data heterogeneity in federated dynamic graph
  learning. Unlike conventional approaches, FedDGL captures temporal dynamics through
  a global knowledge distillation technique and manages client heterogeneity using
  a global prototype-based regularization method. The framework employs contrastive
  learning to generate global prototypes, enhancing feature representation while utilizing
  a prototype similarity-based personalized aggregation strategy for effective adaptation
  to local and global data distributions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
  show that FedDGL achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
  methods, with up to 9.02% and 8.77% gains in local and global testing, respectively,
  compared to FedAvg. These results highlight FedDGLâ€™s effectiveness in improving
  personalized and global model performance in dynamic, heterogeneous federated graph
  learning scenarios.
