abstract: Human pose estimation is a significant research direction in the field of
  computer vision, with critical applications in human motion reconstruction and analysis.
  Currently proposed human pose estimation methods primarily focus on single-modality
  sensor information, such as RGB images and LiDAR point clouds. While these methods
  have achieved promising results within their respective domains, they remain limited
  by the inherent deficiencies of each modality, hindering their applicability across
  diverse real-world scenarios. With the recent introduction of numerous multi-modality
  human pose datasets, multi-modality approaches have begun to develop. However, existing
  multi-modality fusion methods mainly consider the global feature relationships between
  different modalities, without modeling finer-grained features or the dynamic temporal
  relationships between modalities. To address this issue, we propose a novel pipeline
  that integrates point cloud and image features, explicitly encoding fine-grained
  features and dynamic temporal relationships between the two modalities. Additionally,
  we employ a discriminator structure for semi-supervised training. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared
  to previous methods.
